          I’m Abhishek Soni, a Computer Science student working with Java,
Data Structures & Algorithms, DBMS, and web development.

I value discipline, structure, and a systematic way of working. I focus
on building real projects with clarity and consistency, aiming to
understand systems rather than just writing code.

Beyond technology, I have a sense of human behavior. I listen
deeply, understand perspectives beyond words, and support people with
clarity and empathy. I believe strong technology is created where logic,
discipline, and human understanding come together.
